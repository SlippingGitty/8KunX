#THIS IS NOT AN UPDATE TO 8CHANX!

This is not intended to be a continuance of 8chanX. This is merely a page to quickly install 8chanX on 8kun. The only difference here is the addition of the 8kun domain, and a change of the favcon. The following is the original 8chanX github readme + some changes.

#![8](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SlippingGitty/8chanX-for-8kun/2-0_pure/images/logo.png)kunX 2.0 Pure
#[Click here to install](https://github.com/SlippingGitty/8chanX-for-8kun/raw/2-0_pure/8kun-x.user.js)

This branch removes a few features in order to improve compatibility. You should not use this branch if [2.0](https://github.com/Pashe/8chanX/tree/2-0) works for you.
***

This userscript adds various features and options like:
 * Gallery
 * Filters
 * Reverse image search
 * Flag preview
 * Mascots
 * Notifications
 * Relative post dates
 * Post and image counts in the menu
 * Many other poorly written hacks
 * Not as dead as tux's version

This is a userscript, you will need an addon to run it properly
